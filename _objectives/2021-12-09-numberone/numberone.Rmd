The goal: To show my understanding of the learning objectives and provide evidence, I chose a data set about the nutrition facts of Starbucks' drinks. I hope to use this data set to showcase what I have learned about R throughout the semester. 

--------------------------------------

### 1. I can import data from a variety of sources.

```{r importdata, echo=TRUE}
drinks <- read_csv("~/STA 518/CourseProject/Personal-Website/_objectives/2021-12-09-numberone/
                   starbucks_drinkMenu_expanded.csv")
```

![](~/STA 518/Course Project/Personal-Website/_objectives/2021-12-09-numberone/importdata.PNG)


The above code chunk proves that I can import data from an external source, a .csv file. 
I downloaded this dataset onto my computer from Kaggle, then I uploaded the file into
R Studio, then read it into my code. If this was an Excel file, I could have used
drinks <- read_xlsx("~/STA 518/CourseProject/Personal-Website/
_objectives/2021-12-09-numberone/starbucks_drinkMenu_expanded.xlxs") instead. By showing that I can import both Excel and .csv files, that means that I can import data from a variety of sources.


--------------------------------------

### 2. I can write professional reports using R Markdown.
```{r professional_reports, message=TRUE}

```

--------------------------------------

### 3. I can isolate information from a larger data source.

I am going to isolate the drinks that contain coffee or espresso. Coffee is usually
my drink of choice, so I want to compare between the different types. This includes coffee,
classic and signature espresso drinks, and frappuccinos. 
```{r isolate, message=TRUE}

```


--------------------------------------

### 4. I can combine information from multiple data sources.
```{r combine, message=TRUE}

```


--------------------------------------

### 5. I can restructure information to be in a “tidy” format.
```{r tidydata, message=TRUE}

```


--------------------------------------
### 6. I can transform information to be in a format better suited for specific tasks.
```{r transform, message=TRUE}

```
