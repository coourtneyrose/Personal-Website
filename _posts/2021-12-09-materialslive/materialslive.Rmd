This is a seminar by [Alison Hill](https://www.rstudio.com/authors/alison-hill/) and [Desiree De Leon](https://www.rstudio.com/authors/desir%C3%A9e-de-leon/) on how to share R Markdown files and Distill websites online using the drag-and-drop  function on [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/drop).

This [video](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/sharing-on-short-notice-how-to-get-your-materials-online-with-r-markdown/) was very descriptive and helped me a lot with understanding how to make my distill website live for others to view. I was mostly interested in {rmarkdown} and {pagedown}, but they also talk about {bookdown} and {blogdown} if you are interested. This seminar was aimed at educators to help them make more reproducible material for their students.
