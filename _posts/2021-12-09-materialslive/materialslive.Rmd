This is a seminar by [*Alison Hill*](https://www.rstudio.com/authors/alison-hill/) and [*Desiree De Leon*](https://www.rstudio.com/authors/desir%C3%A9e-de-leon/) on how to share R Markdown files and Distill websites online using the drag-and-drop  function on [**Netlify**](https://app.netlify.com/drop). I used Netlify to make my website public. It gave me a random, funny URL, but it only costs about $15/year to create a custom URL. Maybe when I have an actual job, I will do that so my URL isn't www.frosty-beaver-3fd4d5.netlify.app (no joke).

This [**video**](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/sharing-on-short-notice-how-to-get-your-materials-online-with-r-markdown/) was very descriptive and helped me a lot with understanding how to make my distill website live for others to view. I was mostly interested in {rmarkdown} and {pagedown}, but they also talk about {bookdown} and {blogdown} if you are interested. This seminar was aimed at educators to help them make more reproducible material for their students, but it was very helpful for my project too!
