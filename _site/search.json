My goal for an internship is to master my coding skills in R and/or SAS, build a solid foundation to begin my career in biostatistics, creating a network of great contacts and mentors, and getting real world experience in statistics and data analysis.\nPersonal statement\nI am a graduate student at Grand Valley State University studying biostatistics. I built this website for one of my graduate courses, while I was learning R. I hope that this website showcases my abilities in R, because this entire website was built in R. I mostly used the {distill} package to build the structure of the website, {tidyverse}, and {pagedown} to create an additional resume. I also have added some personal touches that I hope will showcase my personality. This website is linked to a Github repository to allow me to quickly see the previous versions of this website.\nAfter graduation from my program in May 2023, I hope to be at a hospital assisting with clinical trials. I am confident that I will be a positive, motivated asset to any company that employs me.\nWebsite contents\nI have included the learning objectives from a course that helped me learned R. Each objective has several sub-objectives. I go through each learning objective in depth in the Learning Objective tab.\nI have included an additional resume that I created within R under the Resume tab.\nI have also included direct links to websites, videos, textbooks, and seminars that I have found helpful throughout my journey of learning R in the Resources tab. There are so many great educators out there that helped me throughout my journey of learning R.\nMy LinkedIn and Github pages are available for quick access with the icons in the top right-hand corner of the navigation bar.\n\n\n\n",
