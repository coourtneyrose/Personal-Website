    "contents": "\nThis Youtube video by Lisa Lendway was really helpful in creating my distill website. Lisa is a professor at Macalester College and an RStudio instructor. This tutorial was from A to Z how to create a beautiful {distill} website. It was inspiring to also see her struggling through R and learning from her mistakes throughout the video. Her finished website from this video looked really cool, so make sure to check that out too.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nThis is a seminar by Alison Hill and Desiree De Leon on how to share R Markdown files and Distill websites online using the drag-and-drop function on Netlify.\nThis video was very descriptive and helped me a lot with understanding how to make my distill website live for others to view. I was mostly interested in {rmarkdown} and {pagedown}, but they also talk about {bookdown} and {blogdown} if you are interested. This seminar was aimed at educators to help them make more reproducible material for their students.\n\n\n\n",
