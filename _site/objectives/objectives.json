I hope to use this data set to showcase what I have learned about R throughout the semester.\n1. I can import data from a variety of sources.\n\n\ndrinks <- read_csv(\"~/STA 518/CourseProject/Personal-Website/_objectives/2021-12-09-numberone/\n                   starbucks_drinkMenu_expanded.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nThe above code chunk proves that I can import data from an external source, a .csv file. I downloaded this dataset onto my computer from Kaggle, then I uploaded the file into R Studio, then read it into my code. If this was an Excel file, I could have used drinks <- read_xlsx(\"~/STA 518/CourseProject/Personal-Website/ _objectives/2021-12-09-numberone/starbucks_drinkMenu_expanded.xlxs\") instead. By showing that I can import both Excel and .csv files, that means that I can import data from a variety of sources.\n2. I can write professional reports using R Markdown.\n\n\n\n3. I can isolate information from a larger data source.\nI am going to isolate the drinks that contain coffee or espresso. Coffee is usually my drink of choice, so I want to compare between the different types. This includes coffee, classic and signature espresso drinks, and frappuccinos.\n\n\n\n4. I can combine information from multiple data sources.\n\n\n\n5. I can restructure information to be in a “tidy” format.\n\n\n\n6. I can transform information to be in a format better suited for specific tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
