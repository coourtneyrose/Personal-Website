### Reflection

I think that I deserve an A for this course, because I have met almost every objective for the course. I hope to prove that in my **Learning Objectives** tab. This course has made me feel successful in learning and understanding what is actually going on in the code to produce the output that is needed. I am particularly proud of this website and how much work I put into it. I knew nothing about R when I entered this course and honestly thought that creating a website was way out of my league. This class gave me the confidence that I needed in R to accomplish something that I am really proud of and hope to continue to make better. Thank you for a great semester, I have really enjoyed learning about R and Git/Github!

### Contents of this website

I have included the learning objectives for STA 518 and evidence that I have satisfied each objective under the **Learning Objectives ** tab. 

I have included my course project, a resume made with {pagedown}, under the **Course Project** tab. 

I have also included direct links to websites, videos, textbooks, and seminars that I have found helpful throughout my journey of learning R in the **Resources** tab. 

My *LinkedIn* and *Github* pages are available for quick access in the top right-hand corner of the navigation bar.


### Plan of Action

After this course, I hope to transform this website into more of a personal website for myself to use. I believe this would be a great demonstration of my skills on RStudio. It will also be convenient, because my resume is already attached. It will also be convenient to easily go back to the resources I have used while learning R to help me in the future.
