### Contents of this website

I have included the learning objectives for STA 518 and evidence that I have satisfied each objective under the **Learning Objectives ** tab. 

I have included my course project, a resume made with {pagedown}, under the **Course Project** tab. 

I have also included direct links to websites, videos, textbooks, and seminars that I have found helpful throughout my journey of learning R in the **Resources** tab. 

My *LinkedIn* and *Github* pages are available for quick access in the top right-hand corner of the navigation bar.

### Plan of Action

After this course, I hope to transform this website into more of a personal website for myself to use. I believe this would be a great demonstration of my skills on RStudio. It will also be convenient, because my resume is already attached. It will also be convenient to easily go back to the resources I have used while learning R to help me in the future.
