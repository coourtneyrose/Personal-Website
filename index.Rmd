### Currently searching...
I am currently searching for an **internship** for the summer of 2022. My goal for an internship is to *master my coding skills in R and/or SAS, build a solid foundation to begin my career in biostatistics, creating a network of great contacts and mentors, and getting real world experience in statistics and data analysis*. 

### Personal statement
I am a graduate student at Grand Valley State University studying biostatistics. I built this website for one of my graduate courses, while I was learning R. I hope that this website showcases my abilities in R, because this entire website was built in R. I mostly used the {distill} package to build the structure of the website, {tidyverse}, and {pagedown} to create an additional resume. I also have added some personal touches that I hope will showcase my personality. This website is linked to a [Github repository](https://github.com/coourtneyrose/Personal-Website) to allow me to quickly see the previous versions of this website.

After graduation from my program in May 2023, I hope to be at a hospital assisting with clinical trials. I am confident that I will be a positive, motivated asset to any company that employs me.


### Website contents

I have included the learning objectives from a course that helped me learned R. Each objective has several sub-objectives. I go through each learning objective in depth in the **Learning Objective** tab.

I have included an additional resume that I created within R under the **Resume** tab.

I have also included direct links to websites, videos, textbooks, and seminars that I have found helpful throughout my journey of learning R in the **Resources** tab. There are so many great educators out there that helped me throughout my journey of learning R.

My *LinkedIn* and *Github* pages are available for quick access with the icons in the top right-hand corner of the navigation bar.
