title: "Courtney Rose's Course Project"
description: This is my course project for STA 518, which doubles as a personal website for myself.
site: distill::distill_website
---

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

# Learn more about creating websites with Distill at:
# https://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html

```
 
### Contents of this website

I have included the learning objectives for STA 518 and evidence that I have satisfied each objective under the **Learning Objectives ** tab. 

I have included my course project, a resume made with {pagedown}, under the **Course Project** tab. 

I have also included direct links to websites, videos, textbooks, and seminars that I have found helpful throughout my journey of learning R in the **Resources** tab. 

### Plan of Action

After this course, I hope to transform this website into more of a personal website for myself to use. I believe this would be a great demonstration of my skills on RStudio.
